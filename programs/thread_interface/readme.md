# c skeleton

taken shamelessly from [here](http://c.learncodethehardway.org/book/ex28.html).

## Description
My threading library is hardly functional, but i did manage to gain enough from
it that i could implement the rest of it in an extra few days.

```make all`` will build the project and put libunmthread.a in ./build/

joining, retuning values, and condition variables are not implemented to any
good degree of satisfaction.
